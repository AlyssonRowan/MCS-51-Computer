#Original Project
**Elektor BASIC Computer**
*Elektor December 1987*

For a while, the MCS-51 range of microcontrollers 
was probably the most accessible on the market. 
The introduction of the 8052AH-BASIC gave a number
of hobbyists their first taste of microcontrollers, 
with the capacity to create a single-board computer
that was both a control system and a development 
system using a high-level language as opposed to
having to face the challenge of programming in 
assembler.

The project articles are included in their entirity.

Sadly the 8052AH-BASIC is no longer available.


I still use the board I built at that time even 
though it is now more than 30 years old.
