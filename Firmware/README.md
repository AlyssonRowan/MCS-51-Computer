# MCS-51 Modular Computer - Firmware


BASIC-52
--------

BASIC-52 was originally developed by Intel for their
8052AH-BASIC chip - an 8052 microcontroller with an 
on-board BASIC interpreter.

Please consider this to be a codebase from which to
develop your own MCS-51 support firmware.

V1.0 was the original release on these devices, but 
was rapidly supplanted by V1.1 which included a number 
of enhancements and bugfixes.

V1.1 continued to be supplied throughout the life of the
device, even though there were bugs in parts of the code.

V1.1++ was a patch for the V1.1 ROM image correcting the
most severe of these bugs.

V1.2 was independently developed to enable 8032 and 8052
devices to run using an off-chip ROM.

V1.3 is designed for devices to run code that allows for
the programming of FLASH PROMs
