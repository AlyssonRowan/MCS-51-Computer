Hardware
--------
While the ownership of the intellectual property of the
hardware is entirely in the hands of the owner of this 
repository, it carries some limitations from the software 
used to design it.

The version of DipTrace used is limited to non-commercial
applications only, so any derivative works would need to 
be re-developed using a less restrictive application.

The design paradigm, however, is based on the use of 100mm
wide PCBs and a shared bus design. You are asked to respect 
both of these factors in your own application in order to
maintain functional and physical compatibility.


Software & Firmware
-------------------
The firmware for this project is fixed firmly as a derivative 
work and will be subject to the copyrights of its various
owners. 


Attribution and Derivative Works
--------------------------------
You are asked to leave all copyright and attribution notices
in the source files of your derivative works.

EGO: You are asked to contact the owner of this repository 
should you find it useful.

Limitations and Liability
-------------------------
This hardware and software property is shared without cost. 
No representation as to merchantability or fitness for purpose
is made whatsoever. Liability for damage consequential to
using any part of this project lies entirely in the hands of 
the user.

Specific exclusions:
No part of this project is to be used for any medical, clinical,
avionic or other system where software or hardware failure could
lead to losses, injury or death. Those systems are designed by
specialist experts for a very good reason.
