HMC-PB-01 8052AH-BASIC Board Adapter
------------------------------------

This PCB is designed to consolidate the signals on
the original Elektor 8052AH-BASIC Basic Computer
project board for compatibility with the MCS-51
Modular Computer.

Note that without modification, the console port
is NOT brought out to the bus and that a second
serial port output is available, exposed at the
port on this board.
