Integrated Backplane
--------------------
- HMC-IB-1 (MOBO)
- HMC-IB-2 (Bus)

This is a pair of boards that are stacked using extended 
pin header sockets. 

The motherboard is a single 100mm square board which
includes basic front panel functionality and power feed
to the bus. A separate, hard wired power supply (5.0V 2A) 
is required.

The daughterboard provides a 4-slot bus powered via the 
motherboard.

It is recommended that this item not be daisy-chained
without very careful consideration. The board is fused
at 2A.

There is no RS232 console option on this PCB. This needs
to be provided separately if required. 

A low frequency clock "pulse" generator is provided for 
applications that require a low-frequency, semi-stable 
clock pulse for operation in the development stage.

The daughter board, built with standard sockets (i.e.
not wire-wrap form) may be used independent of the parent
board as a simple, no-frills 4-slot backplane. A mountable
version of this PCB is available.

With only a plug and a socket, the daughter board could 
also be used as a slot extender for service use.
