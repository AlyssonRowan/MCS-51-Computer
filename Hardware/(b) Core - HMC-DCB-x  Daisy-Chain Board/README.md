Daisy Chain Boards
------------------
- HMC-DCB-1 Short link for Modular Backplane use
- HMC-DCB-2 Long link for integrated backplane use

These board are supplied as two separate PCBs.

One narrow PCB for interlinking two Modular Backplane
segments while maintaining system board separation.
The wider is for linking an integrated backplane with 
a modular backplane segment.

Linking an integrated backplane with a modular backplane
is not recommended other than for development purposes.
