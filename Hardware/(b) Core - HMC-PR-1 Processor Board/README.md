Central Processor Board
-----------------------
- HMC-PR-1 AT89s51 Processor Board

The processor chosen for this project is the Atmel
AT89S51 and AT89S52 microcontroller. These have
4k and 8k of ISP Flash Memory respectively.

The processor board is set up without user SRAM and 
is ready to accept firmware as a basic development 
board. The serial lines are buffered and brought out 
to a header (TTL signals) for connection to a user 
console. RS232 is available via the Front Panel board.

Console (serial) signals are also carried on the bus
ready for embedded terminal hardware.
