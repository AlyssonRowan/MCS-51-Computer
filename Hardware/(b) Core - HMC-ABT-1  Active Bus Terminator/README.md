Active Bus Terminator
---------------------
- HMC-ABT-1

NOTE: 2 terminators are required if used.

While not strictly necessary, this short board is designed
to be inserted in the first and last physical slots on the 
bus, and should reduce signal reflections and timing issues
on the bus - especially when a longer bus is used.

It may be necessary to adjust the target voltage of one or
both terminator channels in order to reduce standing current 
on the bus.
